# Project Title

AirBnB new user booking

## Getting Started

New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities, across 190+ countries. By
accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can
share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first
booking and better forecast demand.

In this project I will be applying Machine Learning classification models to predict the
new user bookings using the data provided here 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings.

### Prerequisites

Data should be downloaded from kaggle and kept under 'all' folder.This shouold be outside 'AirBnb Project' folder. 


## Running the Model

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the 'AirBnb Project' project directory and run the following commands:

ipython notebook Data_Exploration.ipynb
ipython notebook TrainUser_Preparation.ipynb
ipython notebook Session Preparation.ipynb
ipython notebook Model_implementation.ipynb

or

jupyter notebook Data_Exploration.ipynb
ipython notebook TrainUser_Preparation.ipynb
ipython notebook Session Preparation.ipynb
ipython notebook Model_implementation.ipynb
